# Flower-Recognition-and-Detection-with-PyTorch
This is the seventh project for the AI engineering master. The main goal is to develop a highly robust model, capable of automatically classifying flowers with the best possible F1-score (macro) on the test dataset. I need to use techniques such as data augmentations, transfer learning with PyTorch's timm library, YOLO for detections
