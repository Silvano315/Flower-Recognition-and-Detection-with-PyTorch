## Project Overview

This repository is the seventh project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team. 

GreenTech Solutions Ltd., a pioneer in the agritech industry, is faced with the critical need to implement an advanced automatic flower recognition system within its daily operations. GreenTech Solutions Ltd. has started a strategic initiative to develop a prototype AI-based Computer Vision model for automatic flower recognition.

Project Benefits:
- Increased Productivity
- Improved Quality
- Technological Innovation

The main goal is to develop a highly robust model, capable of automatically classifying flowers with the best possible F1-score (macro) on the test dataset. I need to use techniques such as:
- Augmentation Strategies: implement different augmentation techniques to enrich the dataset, improving data variability and quality.
- Network Architectures and Transfer Learning: select and implement one or more neural network architectures wiht PyTorch's timm library, using transfer learning to exploit pre-trained models.
- Validation and Regularization: retraining with validation and regularization techniques to improve the model performance.
- Object detection: this part has to be done using YOLO models and supervsion library from Roboflow.

## Dataset

The dataset provided by ProfessionAI (I can't include it on this repository due to master restrictions) includes two main categories of flowers:

- Daisy: 529 training images, 163 validation, 77 test.
- Dandelion: 746 training images, 201 validation, 105 test.
